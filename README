This is an open source webkit based browser. 

I make money of a similar paid version which currently has unlimited tabs and unlimited bookmarks. Modifiying two values at the top of the main activity "barbones" will turn this into the paid version.

Current issues:
- it doesn't open apps that belong to links like market:// youtube:// etc...
- can't set bookmarks as default view in fullscreen
