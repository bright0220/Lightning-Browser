This is an open source webkit based browser. 

I make money of a similar paid version which currently has unlimited tabs and unlimited bookmarks. Modifiying two values at the top of the main activity "barbones" will turn this into the paid version.

Current issues:
- html 5 videos do not play or do not play well
- issues with android 2.2 and 2.3 have forced me to disable zooming in order to allow for fullscreen mode, I can't publish an update until this is fixed
- websites requesting authentification don't always work well
- you can't view history
- it doesn't open apps that belong to links like market:// youtube:// etc...
- 4.2.2 is having issues, probably will be fixed when they update the sdk to 4.2.2
- not sure what I want to do with translations. all i have is spanish, paid has italian, others want more.
